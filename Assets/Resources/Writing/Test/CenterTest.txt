Narrator
Man, I’m glad to sit down and have a bite to eat. I hope this group coming in doesn’t prove to be something awful.

Idol1
Hey, right now we need to find a new keyboardist. We can point fingers later.

Idol2
And how are we supposed to play like this again?

Idol1
By playing.

Idol3
You’re the one bringing up all the issues.

Idol2
Just because you’ve locked up all your emotions doesn’t mean they’re not there.

Idol3
You’re one to talk. You wouldn’t know what locking your emotions up looked like if it hit you with a truck.

Idol2
And you wouldn’t know what intimacy looked like if it bit you on the ass.

Idol1
Really, Idol2, are you seriously making this about virginity? What are you, a teenage boy?

Idol3
You know she is.

Idol2
Hey!

Idol1 (Amused)
Enough with the ribbing already. Look, we’re weirding out this poor person out.

Narrator
You’re honestly pretty funny. Hey, did I hear you say that you were looking for a keyboardist?

Idol1
Yes-

Idol2
No.

Idol1
Yes, we are.
Would you be down to play a handful of gigs?

Idol3
Around, like, 10

Idol2
More like 2

Idol1
Actually, we’re booked for about 4 or 5 coming up. If you can put up with the rest of the band, that is.

Narrator
Sounds good to me.
