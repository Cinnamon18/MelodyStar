Laundry
Man, I’m glad to sit down and have a bite to eat. I hope this group coming in doesn’t prove to be something awful.

Strummer
Hey, right now we need to find a new keyboardist. We can point fingers later.

Ann
And how are we supposed to play like this again?

Strummer
By playing.

Jett
You’re the one bringing up all the issues.

Ann
Just because you’ve locked up all your emotions doesn’t mean they’re not there.

Jett
You’re one to talk. You wouldn’t know what locking your emotions up looked like if it hit you with a truck.

Ann
And you wouldn’t know what intimacy looked like if it bit you on the ass.

Strummer
Really, Ann, are you seriously making this about virginity? What are you, a teenage boy?

Jett (Amused)
You know she is.

Ann
Hey!

Strummer (Amused)
Enough with the ribbing already. Look, we’re weirding out this poor person out.

Laundry
You’re honestly pretty funny. Hey, did I hear you say that you were looking for a keyboardist?

Strummer
Yes-

Ann
No.

Strummer
Yes, we are.
Would you be down to play a handful of gigs?

Jett
Around, like, 10

Ann
More like 2

Strummer
Actually, we’re booked for about 4 or 5 coming up. If you can put up with the rest of the band, that is.

Laundry
Sounds good to me.
