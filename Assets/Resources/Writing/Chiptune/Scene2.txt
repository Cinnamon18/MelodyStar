Strummer
Well done everybody, I think we’re pulling things together nicely.

Ann (Amused)
Laundry, I think you might have surprised me . . . with how apt your name is. You dress like a dryer.

Jett
Ann, I think you just don’t appreciate the finer points of life.

All

Strummer
I gotta stop doing that.

Ann
I keep thinking he’s going to say something whenever I’m not paying attention.

Strummer
. . . It’s just hard to let go.

Jett
You . . . keep thinking he’s going to say something?

Ann
What’s that supposed to mean?

Strummer
Hey.

Jett
. . . Nothing

Laundry
Uuuhhhh, is this something I should know about?

Strummer (Amused)
What, the constant sniping? It’s just my divine punishment for another life

Ann
Lay off, man.

Strummer (Amused)
So you can lay back on?

Jett (Amused)
I always knew I really a demon.

Ann
You always were.

Jett
Takes one to know one

Ann (Angry)
Listen here you you little-

Strummer
Whoa! Cool it, both of you!
Look, let’s just go to the hotel, alright.

Laundry
Hey, just give me a call before the next gig, alright?

Jett
We’ll get back to you.

Ann
And who made you-

Strummer
We’ll get back to you.

Laundry
I’ll hold my breath

Strummer (Amused)
Not bad, man, not bad.
