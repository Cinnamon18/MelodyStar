Scene: StreetNight

Laundry
(Was it behind the warehouse? I remember there was a bus stop near it…)
(Where was it? I really need to do this laundry.)

Narrator
The “empty” warehouse is alive with light. Earsplitting music thumps from across the street.

Laundry
(Wow.)
(I love doing laundry.)

Narrator
As you walk closer to the “empty” warehouse, you can start to make out some intense lyrics. 
“...EMPIRE OF FLESH…”
“...A BED OF ROTTING MISERY…”
“...GODLESS CHEETOS…”

Laundry
(...)
(Ah! This must be the laundromat.)

Scene: Landromat

Narrator
You walk into the warehouse, and a wave of pure sound erupts in your face. Three figures thrash: one screams, one riffs, and one is ripping apart a drumset.
This might not be the laundromat.

Enter left: Axe

Axe
THE EMPIRE OF FLESH! THE EMPIRE OF FLESH! 
THE EMPIRE OF FLESH... IS NOT VEGETARIAN! 

Laundry
E...excuse me, is this the laundromat?

Axe
THE EMPIRE OF—
Wait, who is that?

Enter center: Roxie

Roxie (wild)
They’re about to be luncheon meat! Hey, Axe—hold my guitar. 

Luncheon Meat
I’m...I’m just looking for...

Axe
Roxie, please. You don’t even like luncheon meat. 
Sorry... about her. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Axe Pecorino.
Are you lost?

Laundry
No, I’m Laundry. Is this the laundromat?

Roxie
…

Axe
It is, actually. There are washing machines under the speakers over there.

Roxie
Washers number 1 and 2 don’t work anymore because Frey used them as snare drums. Smashed them up real good.

Enter right: Frey

Frey
No, they were broken when we got here. 

Axe
This is true. 
Feel free to use the machines. We’ll head out pretty soon.

Laundry
[Nods]

Axe
Where...where’s your laundry?

Narrator
You look back at the heavy metal trio, a slight smile on your face.

Laundry
I am my laundry.

Narrator
You climb into washing machine number 5 and shut the door. 

// The entire screen begins to spin, slowly at first.

Roxie
[Muffled] What

Frey
[Muffled] We…
[Muffled] We need them to join our band. 

Axe
[Muffled] No,

// End scene.
